1) generating ip master list
  100000 random Ip's written to ip_addresses.txt
2) generating unique ip's from file ip_addresses.txt
  there are 99997 UNIQUE Ip's
3) looking for duplicated ip's
  3 ip's were duplicated...writing them to a file
  3 lines written to ip_dupes.txt
4) reading ip_dupes.txt
  81.63.170.156 repeated 2 times
  224.94.148.47 repeated 2 times
  116.109.170.18 repeated 2 times
  3 lines read from ip_dupes.txt
5) replacing ip_addresses.txt with non duplicate IP's
  99997 lines written to ip_addresses.txt
6) math validation
  target list size:                100000
  Unique Ips:                      99997
  Duplicated Ip's aggregate total: 3
  Unique Ip's + Dupped Ip's:       100000
  validation is: true
