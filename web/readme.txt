1. put web friendly content into the content directory (html / files)
2. use command "which ruby" to discover the path to ruby
3. modify the server script shebang to point to your local ruby instance (from step 2)
4. type ./server
5. hit http://localhost:1138/ in a web browser
6. to see the servlet go to: http://localhost:1138/hello?foo&bar

Enjoy!

if you want to change anything modify the server script
you can kill it with crtl-c
